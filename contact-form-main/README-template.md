  - [The challenge]()
This is a contact form, as you can see. The main goal was to create a simple yet effective form that allows users to send messages (queries) directly from the website when they have issues concerning the website service or their accounts. The form needed to include fields for first and last name, email, query type, message, and a consent checkbox to indicate if user wishes to be contacted by the team or not.

  ### what i learnt
  Was assisted by chatgpt but learnt a lot i mean a lot.
  # Controlflow:
  Understood controlflow when i was handling the Querytype section where they were only two option and only one could be checked at a time while the other remained unchecked. The checked had it's background color changed and it's radio button checked whilst the other had the default background and an unchecked radio btn.
  # iteration with for loop
  In the query type section i had to iterate through a node list of radio-btn to carry out the if and else(control flow) on each radio button it was fun doing it. Although i used chatgpt but i better understood it.
  # Validation:
  I had to do various validations and displayed certain messages if the validations were true or not. I had to validate if any inputs were empty or both radio btn were unchecked and displayed an error message for each and if none of the inputs were empty and at least one of the radio buttons were checked a success message was displayed. Had fun doing this.

## Acknowledgement
About 40% of the projects success is dedicated to chatgpt. It was very useful as it helped modified my logic and understood it better 60% goes to myself ðŸ˜‚.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**
