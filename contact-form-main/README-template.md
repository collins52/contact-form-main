  - [The challenge]()
This is a contact form, as you can see. The main goal was to create a simple yet effective form that allows users to send messages (queries) directly from the website when they have issues concerning the website service or their accounts. The form needed to include fields for first and last name, email, query type, message, and a consent checkbox to indicate if user wishes to be contacted by the team or not.

  - [What I learned](#what-i-learned)
  ### what i learnt
  Was assisted by chatgpt but learnt a lot i mean a lot.
  # Controlflow:
  Understood controlflow when i was handling the Querytype section where they were only two option and only one could be checked at a time while the other remained unchecked. The checked had it's background color changed and it's radio button checked whilst the other had the default background and an unchecked radio btn.
  # iteration with for loop
  In the query type section i had to iterate through a node list of radio-btn to carry out the if and else(control flow) on each radio button it was fun doing it. Although i used chatgpt but i better understood it.
  # Validation:
  I had to do various validations and displayed certain messages if the validations were true or not. I had to validate if any inputs were empty or both radio btn were unchecked and displayed an error message for each and if none of the inputs were empty and at least one of the radio buttons were checked a success message was displayed. Had fun doing this.

 ## continued-development:
 Their was this technique used in the radio button section i'd like to master this technique also i'd like to conprehend for each function better.
